## Project Overview

This project explores the performance of a software company's direct and indirect (partner) sales channels. It evaluates opportunity conversion rates, revenue contribution, segment and regional performance, and overall funnel efficiency â€” with the goal of optimizing revenue generation and strategic sales operations.

---

## Business Objective

To provide sales leadership with a data-driven view of:

- Channel performance efficiency (Direct vs Indirect)
- Sales funnel progression
- Regional and segment-based revenue patterns
- Partner effectiveness and enablement needs
- Seasonal and temporal revenue trends

---

## Key Questions Answered

- What is the revenue split between direct and partner channels?
- Which channel is more efficient at progressing and closing opportunities?
- Are there underperforming regions or segments?
- Which partners drive the most revenue â€” and are they progressing deals?
- What are the temporal trends in opportunity creation and revenue generation?

---

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using funnel visualizations, column charts, scatterplots, and revenue-weighted metrics. Opportunities were segmented by:

- Channel type (Direct vs Partner)
- Age and size
- Stage in the sales funnel
- Region and industry segment

---

## Key Findings

### Revenue Contribution

- **Partner channels generate ~70%** of opportunity revenue but hold **most revenue in early stages**.
- Direct channels are more effective at **funnel progression and deal maturity**.

### Funnel Performance

- **Only 3%** of all opportunities reach final sales stage.
- **Indirect deals are 64% stuck in early funnel stages** vs 46% for direct.
- All active opportunities are **over 1 year old**, with **indirect deals aging longer**.

### Partner Analysis

- Top partners (e.g., **Sontaxon, Joblamcom**) contribute high revenue, but **78â€“91% is stalled** in early stages.
- Four underperforming partners (e.g., **Zonronzap, Fasetone**) need enablement and strategy realignment.

### Regional Breakdown

- **East region** performs best for direct sales.  
- **West is underperforming** across both channels â€” a prime area for development.
- Partner channels dominate large deals, while direct teams handle smaller opportunities more efficiently.

### Segment Performance

- **Small & Medium segment** has high opportunity volume but low conversion â€” only **18% of revenue is weighted to close**.
- Suggests **stagnant or low-quality deals** in this segment.

### Temporal Trends

- Revenue peaks correlate with **early-year opportunity creation**.
- Direct channel shows **burst-driven performance**, likely tied to quotas or major wins.
- Opportunity creation slows mid-to-late year, risking pipeline depletion.
